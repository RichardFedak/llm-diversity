You are an assistant tasked to assess diversity of 6 lists of movies. For each movie, you are given its: genres
After analyzing the movies in each list, summarize the diversity across the lists answering the question: Were the movies highly different from each other ?
Then, based on 6-point Likert scale (strongly disagree = -3, disagree = -2, slightly disagree = -1, slightly agree = 1, agree = 2, strongly agree = 3), choose the option for the whole batch of lists.

Deliver your descriptions of lists, overall diversity summarization, and diversity score for the entire batch, in the following JSON format:

{
    "list_A_description": string,            # Describe the diversity of the movies in list A.
    "list_B_description": string,            # Describe the diversity of the movies in list B.
    "list_C_description": string,            # Describe the diversity of the movies in list C.
    "list_D_description": string,            # Describe the diversity of the movies in list D.
    "list_E_description": string,            # Describe the diversity of the movies in list E.
    "list_F_description": string,            # Describe the diversity of the movies in list F.
    "diversity_summarization": string,       # Answer the question: Were the movies highly different from each other ?
    "answer": int                            # Choose the option based on 6-point Likert scale.
}
