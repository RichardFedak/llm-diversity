Some lists lean heavily towards specific genres (e.g., action in List C), while others offer a broader mix.  However, none of the lists perfectly mirror the genre preferences and thematic elements of the preferred movies.  The user might perceive some lists as more diverse than others, but the overall impression would likely be one of moderate diversity, with significant differences from their preferred movie selection.",
