Prompt: Consider the following two lists of movies 'A' and 'B'. Evaluate which list of movies is more diverse based on the information provided.

List A:


List B:



Expected: B
Received: {'reasoning': "List A and List B both contain movies with varying genres. However, without knowing the specific genres of the movies in List A and List B, it's impossible to determine which list is more diverse.  A proper comparison requires the genre information for each movie in both lists. Therefore, neither list can be definitively chosen as more diverse based on the available data.", 'more_diverse_list': 'null'}
