It includes genres like Drama, Mystery, Thriller, Crime, Comedy, Romance, Horror, Biography, History, and Adventure, and Fantasy.  There's a mix of tones, from the psychological thriller of the opening film to the comedic horror of Shaun of the Dead. However, several films share similar thriller/crime elements.",
