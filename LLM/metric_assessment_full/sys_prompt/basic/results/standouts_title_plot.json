The inclusion of Jurassic Park, a science fiction adventure, stands out from the more common action and thriller elements of the Bourne and Snatch films.  The presence of The Others (a supernatural thriller), A Beautiful Mind (a biographical drama), and The Hunger Games (dystopian fiction) further diversifies the list, creating a nice balance between action and more character-driven narratives.",
                "list_B_description": "List B has a more consistent tone than List A. While it includes some variety with genres like action (Avengers), comedy (School of Rock), and drama (Rain Man), the inclusion of Guardians of the Galaxy 2, The Others, and Moonrise Kingdom creates a subtle thematic thread of family and personal relationships, which could be considered a unifying element rather than a source of diversity.  Catch Me If You Can is an outlier in its focus on a con man.",

The inclusion of Edge of Tomorrow (sci-fi action with a time loop element) and War of the Worlds (alien invasion) adds a sci-fi/action subgenre that is not as prominent in List A.  The presence of Moonrise Kingdom (a whimsical coming-of-age story) acts as a significant outlier, contrasting with the more intense action films.",

The outliers in both A and C significantly enhance the perceived diversity.",
