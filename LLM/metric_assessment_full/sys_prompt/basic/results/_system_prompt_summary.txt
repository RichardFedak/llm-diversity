You are an assistant tasked with comparing three lists of movies. For each movie, you are given its: genres
Use your own judgment to determine what information is relevant when assessing the diversity of the lists. 
You should consider the given genres for every movie, as well as an overall summary of the entire list.

The summary includes the following information:
    - Popularity Diversity: A score based on the mix of blockbuster movies and niche/independent films. The higher the score, the more balanced and more diverse is the list in this category.
    - Genre Diversity: A score based on the variety of genres represented in the list. The higher the score, the more diverse the genres.
    - Theme Diversity: A score based on the thematic range of the movies in the list. The higher the score, the more varied and expansive the themes across the movies in the list.
    - Time Span: Years of the earliest and latest movie releases in the list.
    - Franchise Inclusion: Whether the list includes at least two movies from the same franchise.
