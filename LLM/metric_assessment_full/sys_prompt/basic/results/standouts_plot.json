Outliers include the heist movie (\"Danny Ocean...\"), the cannibal killer thriller (\"A young F.B.I. cadet...\"), and the survival story with a tiger (\"A young man who survives...\"). These stand out against the more common themes of psychological drama, romance, and historical fiction.",

The Indiana Jones movie and the psychological thriller about a ballerina (\"Nina is a talented...\") are perhaps the most distinct entries, offering action-adventure and psychological horror elements that differ from the more common themes of psychological drama, romance, and zombie films.",

The outlier here is the story of escaped convicts searching for treasure (\"In the deep south...\"), which provides a contrast to the other films' themes of psychological drama, animation, and musical fantasy.  The inclusion of a musical fantasy element (\"Aspiring musician Miguel...\") also adds diversity.",

The inclusion of a heist movie, a thriller involving a cannibal killer, and a survival story featuring a tiger creates a wider range of genres and themes compared to the other lists.
