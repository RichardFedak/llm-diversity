    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.

    - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.

There is less repetition of genres compared to the other lists.  The overlap between movies is relatively low. \n\nList A: List A presents a mix of genres, but there is some overlap, particularly in the 'drama' category.  There's a bit more genre consistency compared to List C.  The inclusion of a documentary adds a unique element, but the overall spread of genres is narrower than List C.\n\nList B: List B has a noticeable number of movies sharing similar genres, primarily action, animation, adventure, drama, comedy, and crime. While there are some diverse elements (western, musical, documentary), the range is more limited and the overlap is higher than in List A and List C, making it the least diverse.  The presence of multiple movies with similar genre combinations contributes to a perception of less diversity. The correct order reflects a progression from the most limited genre variety (List B) to the broadest genre variety (List C), with List A falling in between.  List A shows more diversity than List B due to a slightly wider range of genres and less repetition, despite some overlap.

Prompt: You are an evaluator. You are given three lists of movies with titles and genres provided. Your task is to order the lists from least to most diverse based on the information given and your knowledge.

Focus on the following two aspects:
1. Genres - This is the most important factor in determining diversity.
2. Plot and Themes - Only if the genres are almost the same or overlap significantly between the lists, use plot and themes to differentiate them.

1. Focus on Genres:
    - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.

Prompt: You are an evaluator. You are given three lists of movies with titles and genres provided. Your task is to order the lists from least to most diverse based on the information given and your knowledge.

Focus on the following two aspects:
1. Genres - This is the most important factor in determining diversity.

1. Focus on Genres:
    - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.
