    - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.

    - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.

Prompt: You are an evaluator. You are given three lists of movies with titles and genres provided. Your task is to order the lists from least to most diverse based on the information given and your knowledge.

Focus on the following two aspects:
1. Genres - This is the most important factor in determining diversity.
2. Plot and Themes - Only if the genres are almost the same or overlap significantly between the lists, use plot and themes to differentiate them.

1. Focus on Genres:
    - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.

Received: {'reasoning': "List A shows less diversity in genres compared to the other lists.  Many movies share 'Action' and 'Thriller'. List C has a broader range of genres than A, with the addition of 'Mystery' and 'Sci-Fi' not present in all movies. List B exhibits the most diverse genres, including 'Family', 'Fantasy', and a greater variety of action-adventure subgenres.  The repetition of movies across lists further supports this assessment; 'Kingsman' and 'Deadpool' appear in both A and B, suggesting a narrower focus in those lists. 'Gladiator', 'American History X', and 'Pitch Black' are shared between A and C, indicating a somewhat broader scope in List C.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.

1. Focus on Genres:
    - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.

Expected: {'reasoning': 'List B shows less diversity in genres compared to lists A and C.  While it has a range (comedy, drama, biography, etc.), the representation of those genres is less spread out than in the other lists. List A is more diverse than B because it introduces animation, short films, and family movies which broadens the genre representation further. Finally, List C exhibits the highest degree of diversity, encompassing a wide variety of genres, including action, horror, sci-fi, and a high representation of documentary and biographical films.

Prompt: You are an evaluator. You are given three lists of movies with titles and genres provided. Your task is to order the lists from least to most diverse based on the information given and your knowledge.

Focus on the following two aspects:
1. Genres - This is the most important factor in determining diversity.
2. Plot and Themes - Only if the genres are almost the same or overlap significantly between the lists, use plot and themes to differentiate them.

1. Focus on Genres:
    - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.

1. Focus on Genres:
    - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.

Prompt: You are an evaluator. You are given three lists of movies with titles and genres provided. Your task is to order the lists from least to most diverse based on the information given and your knowledge.

Focus on the following two aspects:
1. Genres - This is the most important factor in determining diversity.

1. Focus on Genres:
    - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
    - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
    - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.
