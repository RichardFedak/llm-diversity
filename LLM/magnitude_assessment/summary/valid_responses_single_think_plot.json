While it includes popular and less popular films, its genre and theme diversity are relatively limited compared to List A and List C. Several genres, like Animation, Drama, and Comedy, recur and there is some thematic repetition (e.g., self-discovery is prevalent across multiple films).  The low scores across Popularity Diversity, Genre Diversity and Theme Diversity reinforce this conclusion."
