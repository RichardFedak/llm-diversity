                "list_C_description": "List C demonstrates a good balance of genres (action, animation, drama, adventure, superhero) and time periods. The inclusion of a more recent animated film and a superhero film enhances its diversity compared to the other lists.",

Lists A and B show some diversity but are less varied in their thematic and stylistic choices. List A has a slightly more varied genre selection than List B, but List C surpasses both in overall diversity.",
