Both a social justice story and a personally driven narrative, the film chronicles this capital case from 1984 through 2004. With exclusive footage from two decades, the film frames the judicial and emotional response to a chilling crime - and the implications that reverberate from Hunt's conviction - against a backdrop of class and racial bias in the South and in the American criminal justice system. This documentary is the culmination of ten years of research and filming. In 1993, inspired by claims of injustice and police conspiracy, the filmmakers began to shoot in North Carolina. Working from a mix of formats (16mm and 24P video) the film melds the visceral reality of a murder case with first person accounts and cinematic imagery, illuminating perceptions and memories of events as they unfolded for the people closest to this haunting story. This unique look at one man's loss and redemption challenges the assumption that all Americans have the right to unbiased justice. Hunt's story - while one man's personal journey - reflects systemic issues of national concern: cross-racial eyewitness identification, prosecutorial misconduct, inexperienced defense attorneys assigned to capital cases, racial bias in death penalty cases and errors in police procedure. Barry Scheck from The Innocence Project, who worked on Hunt's case for ten years, and Gary Wells, professor and eyewitness expert, offer concrete examples where errors occurred in Hunt's saga and offer future remedies and effective ideas to prevent future \"Darryl Hunts.\" Hunt himself addresses the need for systemic reforms to prevent wrongful convictions, underscoring the haunting reality that Hunt could have been sentenced to death and we would never have known this story.\u00e2\u20ac\u201dAnnie Sundberg\n\n\n\nSummary:\nPopularity Diversity: The list includes both popular movies like \\\"300\\\" and \\\"Monsters University\\\", and less popular or niche films like \\\"Period.

It includes a mix of blockbuster and independent films, spanning a wider range of genres (Action, Sci-Fi, Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy, Romance, Biography, Drama, History, Crime, and Thriller). The themes explored are also quite varied, from deception and reality to survival and resilience, the horrors of war, and ancient curses. The time span is broader (1993-2018), and while it includes movies from franchises, it's not as heavily reliant on them as List A.",
                "list_C_description": "List C shows moderate-to-high diversity. It features a mix of popular and niche films, covering a broad range of genres (Action, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Biography, Drama, Thriller, Animation, Adventure, Fantasy, Romance, Documentary, History, and Sport). The themes are diverse, but some, like personal struggles, are more prominent than others. The time span is similar to List B, and the absence of franchise inclusion contributes to its unique character. However, the inclusion of multiple stand-up specials and documentaries slightly reduces the overall diversity compared to List B.",
                "comparison": "List B stands out as the most diverse, showcasing a balanced mix of popular and less mainstream films, a wide array of genres and themes, and a broader time span. List A is less diverse due to its focus on blockbuster franchises and repetitive genres and themes. List C offers a good mix of genres and themes but is slightly less diverse than List B due to the inclusion of multiple documentaries and stand-up specials, which reduces the overall thematic and genre variety.",
