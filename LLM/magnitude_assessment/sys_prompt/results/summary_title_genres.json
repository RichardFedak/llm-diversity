                "list_A_description": "List A shows moderate diversity.  While it includes blockbuster movies like the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings franchises, and others like The Matrix and Avatar, its genre and theme diversity are limited by the repetition of action, adventure, and fantasy genres and related themes. The time span is relatively short (1999-2012), and the heavy franchise inclusion reduces the overall diversity.",
                "list_B_description": "List B demonstrates high diversity. It successfully balances blockbuster films with more niche titles, resulting in a strong popularity diversity score.  The genre variety is excellent, encompassing animation, action, sci-fi, drama, comedy, and more, with minimal repetition. The thematic range is also broad, covering diverse topics such as war, survival, heroism, and betrayal. The time span (1993-2018) is wider than List A, and while franchise inclusion exists, it doesn't dominate the list.",
                "list_C_description": "List C exhibits moderate-to-high diversity. It features a mix of popular and less-known films, creating a balanced popularity diversity. The genre range is wide, including documentary, animation, and various dramatic genres. However, the repetition of comedy and documentary genres slightly reduces the overall genre diversity score. The themes are varied, but some thematic overlaps reduce the theme diversity score. The time span (1999-2018) is considerable, and the absence of franchise inclusion contributes positively to the overall diversity.",
                "comparison": "List B stands out as the most diverse, followed by List C and then List A. List B's superior genre and theme diversity, balanced popularity representation, and broader time span contribute to its higher diversity score. List C shows good diversity but has some genre repetition. List A is the least diverse due to its heavy reliance on blockbuster franchises and limited thematic range.",
