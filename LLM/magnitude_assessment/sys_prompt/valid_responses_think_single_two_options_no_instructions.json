Both a social justice story and a personally driven narrative, the film chronicles this capital case from 1984 through 2004. With exclusive footage from two decades, the film frames the judicial and emotional response to a chilling crime - and the implications that reverberate from Hunt's conviction - against a backdrop of class and racial bias in the South and in the American criminal justice system. This documentary is the culmination of ten years of research and filming. In 1993, inspired by claims of injustice and police conspiracy, the filmmakers began to shoot in North Carolina. Working from a mix of formats (16mm and 24P video) the film melds the visceral reality of a murder case with first person accounts and cinematic imagery, illuminating perceptions and memories of events as they unfolded for the people closest to this haunting story. This unique look at one man's loss and redemption challenges the assumption that all Americans have the right to unbiased justice. Hunt's story - while one man's personal journey - reflects systemic issues of national concern: cross-racial eyewitness identification, prosecutorial misconduct, inexperienced defense attorneys assigned to capital cases, racial bias in death penalty cases and errors in police procedure. Barry Scheck from The Innocence Project, who worked on Hunt's case for ten years, and Gary Wells, professor and eyewitness expert, offer concrete examples where errors occurred in Hunt's saga and offer future remedies and effective ideas to prevent future \"Darryl Hunts.\" Hunt himself addresses the need for systemic reforms to prevent wrongful convictions, underscoring the haunting reality that Hunt could have been sentenced to death and we would never have known this story.\u2014Annie Sundberg\n\nList B:\n- 300 (2007) - Genres of the movie: Action, Drama - Plot of the movie: King Leonidas of Sparta and a force of 300 men fight the Persians at Thermopylae in 480 B.C.\n- Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) - Genres of the movie: Adventure, Comedy - Plot of the movie: A Korean-American office worker and his Indian-American stoner friend embark on a quest to satisfy their desire for White Castle burgers.\n- Monsters University (2013) - Genres of the movie: Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy, Sci-Fi - Plot of the movie: A look at the relationship between Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. \"Sully\" Sullivan (John Goodman) during their days at Monsters University, when they weren't necessarily the best of friends.\n- Beautiful Mind, A (2001) - Genres of the movie: Biography, Drama - Plot of the movie: After John Nash, a brilliant but asocial mathematician, accepts secret work in cryptography, his life takes a turn for the nightmarish.\n- Blind Side, The  (2009) - Genres of the movie: Biography, Drama, Sport - Plot of the movie: The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All-American football player and first-round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family.\n- Argo (2012) - Genres of the movie: Biography, Drama, Thriller - Plot of the movie: Acting under the cover of a Hollywood producer scouting a location for a science fiction film, a CIA agent launches a dangerous operation to rescue six Americans in Tehran during the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran in 1979.\n- Brave (2012) - Genres of the movie: Animation, Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Family, Fantasy, Mystery - Plot of the movie: Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom.
