List B's plots focus on action-adventure (Mummy Returns, Indiana Jones), some on character drama (The Blind Side, Whiplash), and a couple on crime and espionage (Focus, Saving Private Ryan). In terms of storytelling, List A offers a mix of linear narratives and more complex, interwoven storylines.  List B's stories are generally more straightforward narratives.

Both a social justice story and a personally driven narrative, the film chronicles this capital case from 1984 through 2004.

Although both lists include the same movie, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, List A has a noticeable overrepresentation of fantasy films, particularly within the Harry Potter franchise.  The inclusion of Iron Man 2 and Shrek adds some variety in terms of genre (sci-fi and animation), but the overall thematic and stylistic consistency across the majority of the films limits the diversity. In contrast, List B demonstrates greater diversity across various genres and storytelling styles, including documentaries (Rize, Lewis Black: In God We Rust, My Octopus Teacher), war films (Fury), biographical dramas (Brexit: The Uncivil War, Rebel in the Rye), and comedies (Another Gay Sequel). The presence of these diverse genres indicates a wider range of themes and narrative approaches compared to List A.",
