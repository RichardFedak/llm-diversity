Focus on the following two aspects:
1. Genres - This is the most important factor in determining diversity.
2. Plot and Themes - Only if the genres are almost the same or overlap significantly between the lists, use plot and themes to differentiate them.

1. Focus on Genres:
   - Assess the variety and uniqueness of genres in each list.
   - Identify how diverse the genres are within each list and across lists.

2. Focus on Plot and Themes:
   - If genres are similar or overlap significantly between the lists:
    - Analyze the plots to find nuanced differences in storytelling approaches.
    - Evaluate the overarching themes and how they contribute to the distinctiveness of each list.
