# Leveraging LLMs for diversity understanding in recommender systems

The primary goal of recommender systems is to provide users with relevant items. However, relevance alone is not sufficient to ensure a high-quality recommendation experience. Other objectives, such as diversity, also play a crucial role in enhancing user satisfaction. Although numerous methods have been developed to incorporate diversity into recommendations, many of them fall short when evaluated from the perspective of actual user perception. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs) and their increasing use in recommender systems, their role in supporting secondary objectives has only started to be explored and still needs more research. This thesis explores whether LLMs perceive diversity in recommendations in a similar way as users and proposes the implementation of a method that takes advantage of LLMs for diversification that is compared to the existing diversification technique in a user study.
